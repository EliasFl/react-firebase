## Register and Login with Firebase

A login and register React App using Firebase. Created with the intention to practice React, React Router v4 and more. 

To view the project, download or clone this repo and run the following commands:

```
yarn install
```
```
yarn start
```

It will open a new tab on your browser with localhost:3000 on it.

I will improve this project as soon as a I learn more about React and Redux.
